HTTP application template for quickly creating simple but powerful web applications and APIs. «Out of the box», the application template is configured to work with JSON for rapid REST API development.

The core of this application template is the [httpsoft/http-basis](https://github.com/httpsoft/http-basis) microframework. By default, the [devanych/di-container](https://github.com/devanych/di-container) that implements [PSR-11](https://github.com/php-fig/container) and the [monolog/monolog](https://github.com/Seldaek/monolog) logger that implements [PSR-3](https://github.com/php-fig/log) are also used. You can easily change the container and logger to your preferred implementations of the corresponding PSRs.

## Installation

This project template requires PHP version 7.4 or later.

```bash

## Testing and checking

The following commands are run in the application directory:

* `composer run test` — runs tests.
* `composer run static` — runs static analysis code.
* `composer run cs-check` — runs checking coding standards.
* `composer run cs-fix` — runs automatic correction of violations of encoding standards.
* `composer run check` — runs checking coding standards, static analysis code and tests.

## Directory structure

```
